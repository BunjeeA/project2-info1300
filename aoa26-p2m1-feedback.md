# Project 2, Milestone 1 (p2m1) Feedback

This milestone is graded for a **completion grade _by task (section)_**. If you tried to complete the task, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that task**. If a task is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. There is no partial credit within a specific task. The checkbox items below are only for feedback; the checkboxes have no relation to your completion grade. **(An unchecked box does not mean you were deducted points for that item.)**

All files must be in the location specified in the assignment's requirements for credit; our grading process cannot reliably locate your work in other locations.

For _some_ assignments, we provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. **Our feedback is designed to help you learn more;** our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you receive, you are responsible for meeting all the project's requirements in your final submission.

## User Research

- [x] Clearly identifies an appropriate audience.
- [x] Audience is specific but not arbitrary (e.g. Cornell students that live downtown... Why just students there? Why Cornell students and not Ithaca College students?)

- [x] User interview questions attempt to understand the user's goals.
- [x] Interview questions are neutral; no leading questions.
- [x] Questions do not ask users to speculate (e.g. "usually", "typically", "how do you...", etc.) or what they want; questions ask users to recall specific incidents.

- [x] Documentation from interviews with at least 3 users (must include interview notes).

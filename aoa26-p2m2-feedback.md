# Project 2, Milestone 2 (p2m2) Feedback

This milestone is graded for a **completion grade _by task (section)_**. If you tried to complete the task, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that task**. If a task is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. There is no partial credit within a specific task. The checkbox items below are only for feedback; the checkboxes have no relation to your completion grade. **(An unchecked box does not mean you were deducted points for that item.)**

All files must be in the location specified in the assignment's requirements for credit; our grading process cannot reliably locate your work in other locations.

For _some_ assignments, we provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. **Our feedback is designed to help you learn more;** our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you receive, you are responsible for meeting all the project's requirements in your final submission.

## Draft Website

**Grader Instructions:** Students were required to "code a **draft** version" of their website. For completion credit, the student must have all the site's "content in HTML files." This means the student must demonstrate a **good faith effort to have several HTML files with substantial content**.

**Content:**

- [x] Draft website with at least 3 HTML files exists.
- [ ] Each page includes **substantial** content; each page is content rich; website is not "minimal" or sparse.
- [ ] Website includes **substantial** text content with _some_ media content.
- [ ] Website is _appropriately_ ambitious as the second project of a web design and programming class; 3-5 substantial pages -- not too big, not too small.

**Design:**

- [ ] Content is appropriate for the site's audience and addresses their goals.
- [ ] _Design first, then code_ was practiced.
- [ ] Coded website is consistent with design journey.

**HTML:**

- [x] All HTML files are located in the root of the repository (no sub-folders!)
- [x] Main/Home page filename is exactly **index.html** (lowercase).
- [x] All HTML file names are lowercase.
- [x] HTML structures the content and provides semantic meaning. HTML is not used for formatting/styling (i.e. `<br/>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc.)
- [x] All included HTML files are reachable; no dead end or broken links.
- [ ] HTML code validates with no errors. Warnings are okay.
- [x] Code is easily readable and well formatted (i.e. properly indented, etc.)

**CSS:**

- [x] The site's CSS file is located inside a **styles** (lowercase) folder.
- [x] Only one CSS file (i.e. site.css) exists, and it is used to style every HTML page.
- [x] Only external styling is used. No internal (`<style>`) or inline (`style=""`) styling permitted.
- [x] All font properties fallback to generic font families.
- [x] CSS code validates with no errors. Warnings are okay.
- [x] Code is easily readable and well formatted (i.e. properly indented, etc.)

**Images:**

- [ ] Site includes some images.
- [ ] All resources (i.e. images) use relative URLs. (no hotlinking, no URLs that start with "/")
- [ ] All image files are located inside an **images** (lowercase) folder at the root of the repository.
- [ ] All image file names are lowercase and do **not** include any special characters like spaces or colons (e.g. ":".)
- [ ] Images are not "resized" with HTML or CSS.
- [ ] Citations: Resources appear to be cited according to course policy.

**Best Practices:**

- [x] All website resources are **outside the "design-plan"** folder; The "design-plan" folder is _only_ for the design journey.

**Draft Website: 0 / 6 points** _(full, half, or no credit)_
> **Reason for incomplete score (0), if applicable:**
> no website content at all on 3 pages, no images, and not all html files validate.


## Semi-Responsive Draft Website

**Grader Instructions:** Students were required to "code some responsive elements" of their website. For completion credit, the student must have made an attempt at coding  some of their sites responsiveness. This means the student must demonstrate a **good faith effort to have coded some media queries**.

**Grader Instructions:** When testing for responsiveness, re-size the browser window. **Do not use responsive design mode in the browsers' Developer Tools!**

**Responsive Design:**

- [ ] Responsive design is implemented with at least 1 media query.
- [ ] Website is responsive for "narrow" and "wide" screen widths.
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints are _fluid_ (There are no abrupt changes (i.e. thrashing/flickering) when re-sizing the browser window.)
- [ ] Responsive design _"fits"_ the content and makes effective use of the screen space regardless of screen size.
- [ ] Responsive design is aesthetically pleasing.
- [ ] Responsive design employs visual design principles and common web design patterns.

**Responsive Website: 0 / 4 points** _(full or no credit)_
> **Reason for incomplete score (0), if applicable:**
> no responsive design included.

> **What did you do well?**
> nice job with the last page.

> **What might you need to work on for the final submission?**
> add images, content, and responsive design.


## Overall

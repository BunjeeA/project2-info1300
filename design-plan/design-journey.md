# Project 2: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Understanding Users (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 1)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.
> You are **required to author 3 of your own questions**.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, my name is Abolaji Awoyomi and I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am re-designing the website for Ithaca's Apple Harvest Festival. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10 minutes. You are free to quit at any time.

(These questions assume you are interviewing a festival attendee at the festival. If you didn't attend the festival, you may revise the questions and instead ask the participant to recall the last festival/event they attended. Do not ask them to speculate about visiting the Apple Harvest Festival. User speculation provides biased data.)

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

2. What brought you to visit the Apple Harvest Festival?

3. Before you went to the festival, did you seek out any information about the festival before attending?
3a. If yes, What information were you specifically looking for? Did you find it? How did you access that information?

4. When you arrived at the festival, how did you plan your activities?
4a. How did you find out about these activities?

5. Now that you're here participating in the festival, have you found more information that you didn’t have before?

6. Have you heard of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival?If you have, can you tell me what you know about the festival?

7. If you haven't heard of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, are you familiar with any events in the Ithaca area? How many have you attended?

8. Of the events you've been to(including the Apple Harvest Festival), what have been some positive/negative experiences with them?

9. What aspects of a festival make it more likely for you to go?

...

n. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

**After the interview:** This was really helpful. Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. Have a great day!

### Goals (Milestone 1)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Have clear layout and descriptions of activities/attractions available

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - As far as theme, this should be a bright element on the website so that it draws attention
  - When listing these attractions, we can use exciting language to make the user more excited to try it out in person
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - When a something catches a user's eye, you want to keep their attention for as long as possible and make it memorable.

Goal 2: Recommendations/Reviews

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Have sections for testimonials and messages that reach out to college students to especially try somethingg
  - Perhaps on the attractions page or have a section just for testimonials of other students and people that have participated
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - From what I gathered in my interviews, college students that attend these events usually go with friends and family. Once the event has completed, they will all go back home and share the good/bad experiences with those who hadn't gone which garners more interest for the next year
  - If we show students that other people like them enjoyed the event, then we can continually increase engagement at the event

Goal 3: Make sure basic information is readily accessible

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will designate the home page to house certain info(Title, Time, Place, catchy facts about festival)
  - Somewhere else on the page I can add travel information from key places like Cornell campus, etc
  - The site should also be able to seen well on mobile device

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - As far as mobile development, nowadays QR codes are used to link site from fliers and it would make a lot of sense for the siite to look good on a phone that will be used more often


### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. .

I think that my website's audience will be specifically marketed towards college students in the area(Cornell/Ithaca College.) From what I know about Ithaca, there isn't too much here and that most businesses are benefitting from college students making purchases and telling their friends about experiences they have. If we market this website with the college-aged students in mind, we are more likely to generate more interest for the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival and in turn, for all events in the Ithaca area.

## Festival/Event Website Design Exploration (Milestone 1)

Identify three festival or event websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <https://angelcityjazz.com/>

    ![Angel City Jazz Narrow](/design-plan/m-content/narrow1.png)

    ![Angel City Jazz Wide](/design-plan/m-content/wide1.png)

    ![Newport Folk Narrow](/design-plan/m-content/narrow3.png)

    ![Newport Folk Wide](/design-plan/m-content/wide3.png)


### Festival/Event Website 1 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

The Angel City Jazz Festival website shows a good visual layout taking advantage of multiple images on the website. They include a navigation bar element that links all of its different pages. They even have a page that shows media from old festivals in case users want to experience what the festival has been like in the past. Using the color scheme and proper spacing, it's very clear what each section is about and provides a positive visual experience.


### Festival/Event Website 2 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

The Louisiana Crawfish Festival website is a very simplistically designed website. It's a static website with all of it's textual sections stacked on top of each other. There are very little images besides the background for the screen and the title. I think that this website is well designed but for our purpose we would need to add a navigation element. It works for this website because it mostly for buying the tickets and nothing else.


### Festival/Event Website 3 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

The Newport Folk Festival website is fairly similar to the Angel City Jazz Festival. They both use similar block grids for displaying images and text. This website also incorporates a navigation for the new lineups, tickets, events, a shop, etc. The mobile design of the w


## Content Planning (Milestone 1)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 1)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

- Navbar with links
- Homepage with photos and text
- Each navbar page will also have photos and text


### Content Justification (Milestone 1)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.


## Information Architecture (Milestone 1)

### Content Organization (Milestone 1)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

![Card Sorting 1](/design-plan/m-content/cardSort1.jpg)
This card sorting has 4 pages: Home, History, Activities and Help. The Home page will have general intro information to the festival and entertainment and vendors. The History page will have the 40th Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival history text context and perhaps past images. The Activities page will have the Things to Do text content and pictures of those activities as well. Finally, the Help page will host FAQ, directions, and TCAT bus schedules.

![Card Sorting 2](/design-plan/m-content/cardSort2.jpg)
This card sorting has 4 pages. One page will be solely for things to do while another page is entertainment and vendors. The help page would be the same with FAQ, directions, and TCAT bus schedules. The final page is just the history of the festival.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 1)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

I plan on using card sorting 1. The 2nd card sorting will took a lot more work to organize the information well because there is so much to condense on one page. The 1st card sorting uses the navbar to it's advantage and with the aid of images, they can understand more.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

This organization makes a lot of sense because it has titles that appeal to the average college student. Activities would probably be the most visited as they want to know what they're getting into.


### Navigation (Milestone 1)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- History
- Activities
- Help

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

Each page is very clear as to what the information is on the page. Also, the titles are able to understood by the college students as well. Activities would probably be the most visited as they want to know what they're getting into.


## Visual Theme (Milestone 1)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

I plan to have earth tones as far as color scheme or at least something that reflects autumn/fall. With language, I plan on having language that is on the reading/writing level of college students but also accessible to younger audiences.

## Design (Milestone 1)

Document your site's layout.

### Layout Exploration (Milestone 1)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

This first mobile design...

This first desktop design...
![Desktop Wireframe #1](/design-plan/m-content/desktopWF1.jpg)

This second desktop design...
![Desktop Wireframe #2](/design-plan/m-content/desktopWF2.jpg)


### Final Design (Milestone 1)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Narrow (Mobile) Design:**
![Mobile Wireframe #2](/design-plan/m-content/mobileWF2.jpg)
This wireframe shrinks(scales) the image at the top and it also condenses the writing in their individual sections.

**Wide (Wide) Design:**
![Desktop Wireframe #2](/design-plan/m-content/desktopWF2.jpg)
This wireframe expands the image at the top to fit the whole screen width. The text sections all take up equal width to fit across the whole screen as well.

### Design Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specially, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

This design is appropriate for my audience because it first attempts to grab the user visually with images. If possible, I'd like to use images where students(or people that look like students) are depicted so that students visiting the website understand that people like them have enjoyed the event. Also on the home page, I will use text sections to display important information about the festival such as some activities, new programs, etc.


## User Testing (Final Submission)

### User Testing Tasks (Final Submission)
> Plan out your user testing tasks before doing your user testing.
> These must be actual user testing tasks.
> **Tasks are not questions!**

1. Find examples of things you can do in the Ithaca area outside of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival

2. Find the list of tcat bus routes. List all of the buses that stop at Ithaca Commons for the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival


### Participant 1 (Final Submission)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

    The participant is from Texas and attends Cornell University currently an RA in RBG dorm. She is very friendly and was very receptive of helping me with the user testing of this project.


2. Does the user belong to your audience of the site?

    > If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the audience?

    Yes, she attends Cornell University and could be apart of people who have attended/want to attend the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.


### Participant 1 -- Testing Notes (Final Submission)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test.

- For the first test, I read the task to the user. After, she read the home page, clicked activities in the navigation bar. From there, she read out the different sections of activities that aren't the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.(Finished the first test). I read the second test aloud and she proceeded. She clicked to the home screen on the navigation bar but did not find the answers she was looking for despite looking at the map. She then clicked on the help page, and saw a list of bus routes near the bottom. After searching thhrough, she read to me the different buses that listed the Ithaca Commmons as a stop.(Finished the second test)


### Participant 2 (Final Submission)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

    This user is a freshman at Cornell university. He did not attend the harvest festival and initially did not want to participate in user testing but reconsidered.


2. Does the user belong to your audience of the site?

    > If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the audience?

    Yes, cornell student.


### Participant 2 -- Testing Notes (Final Submission)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test.

    The participant read the tasks himself and first went to the help section to find the bus routes. He listed them all by using command F to search "Ithaca Commons". He then went to the activities page and read the different activities outside of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. He then chose to click the history page and read the testimonials on the event.


### Participant 3 (Final Submission)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

    This participant is a parent of a Cornell student. They are from Michigan and they are a hedge fund manager. They seemed somewhat stoic but warm enough to recieve my invitation to user test.


2. Does the user belong to your audience of the site?

    > If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the audience?

    No, but in this way, I can gauge how people of different age groups interact with this site and whether or not I should/could expand the audience.


### Participant 3 -- Testing Notes (Final Submission)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test.
    The participant listened to both tasks as I read them. He clicked the activities page link and saw all of the activities for task1. Next, he clicked the help page and saw the list of TCAT bus routes. He then asked if the website was just for the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival or for Ithacan events in general.


### Potential Changes Based on User Testing (Final Submission)
> What changes would you make to your design based on user testing?
> Note: You are not required to change your design. Simply tell  us what you would change.

Later on, I would add interactivity to the help page as far as the tcat bus routes because it's hard to navigate with all of the words on the page. Also, I would add testimonials to the home screen because if that's what would improve user's idea of the festival, they should see it earlier on.


## Rationale (Final Submission)

**This rationale should be polished writing:** one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs about a paragraph. Sketches can often help tell the story of your design.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.

### Audience (Final Submission)
> A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.

My audience for this website is college students in the Ithaca area.


### Audience Goals
> Explain how your site's design addresses the goals of the audience.

This sites design incorporates testimonials that I think engage the user and help them understand that others also enjoyed their time there. Another goal I had was to hold on to user attention for as long as possible.


### Visual Design (Final Submission)
> An explanation of how the final design is appropriate for your audience.
> Include design patterns in your rationale.

This design is centered around a top navigation bar. That is the primary way of moving through the site and seeing the different pages of the site. As the main audience is students, I tried to only put information that would be most interesting to them as to garner and keep their attention.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

I learned that the way people interpret information not only changed based on the person but also how the information is formatted. There's a alot of design principles I learned through this class that I have started to take note of in other websites as well.
